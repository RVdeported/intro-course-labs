## Task 1: Artifact Registries Research

#### 1. Google Cloud Platform
-- **Google Container Registry:** provides a private Docker storage for container images utilizing Google Cloud. 
  -- integration with Kubernetes Engine and Google CI/CD tools   
  -- offers vulnerability scanning, access control options and other security features
-- **Google Artifact Registry:** In addition to the Google Container Registry, GCP also offers the Google Artifact Registry, which extends the capabilities of Container Registry. It's a more comprehensive service that allows us to manage and secure our software artifacts, including container images, language packages, and more, in a single location
  -- support of Docker images, npm packages and other applications.
  -- offers various permission settings utilizing Cloud identity and access management.
  -- Supports regional and multi-regional repositories.

#### 2. Azure Artifact services
-- **Azure Container Registry:** is a private Docker registry service that servess the Azure deployments. 
  -- integration with microservices management, including Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and DC/OS
  -- integration with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  -- offers network-close registry in multiple regions
  -- offer sevurity features with user authentification and control access

### 3. Amazon Web Services
-- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR):** is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. 
  -- integration with Amazon Elastic Container Service offering optimizations to product workflow
  -- security features utilizing access control settings
  -- automation of application scaling


## Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research

#### 1. Google Cloud Platform
-- **Google Cloud Functions:** offers serverless execution environment for single-purpose cloud services.
  -- event-driven system: code execution on certain events, such as network request, database update or etc.
  -- integration with GCPâ€™s machine learning and other services

#### 2. Azure Serverless Platform
-- **Azure Functions:** allows to run small pieces of code isolated from the built infrastructure.
  -- event-driven system: code execution on certain events, such as network request, database update or etc.
  -- integration with other Azure services like database management
  -- allow to define stateful workflow
  -- supports huge variety of programming languages

#### 3. AWS Serverless Platform
-- **AWS Lambda:** lets us run our code without provisioning or managing servers.
  -- runs code without provisioning servers
  -- automatically scales our application by running code in response to each trigger.
  -- Supports a variety of programming languages
