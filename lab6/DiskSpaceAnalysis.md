## Lab 6 Task 1 - Disk nalysis

1. **Analysis of Disk Space** can be done on linux via the `df` comand. This will output total and available mamory for each device. In my case there was an output as stated in the `disk.txt` file
2. **Inode information** can be retrieved by the `ls -i` command. In my case I checked the inode of `disk.txt` file and recieved the following output: `29924816 temp.txt`
3. My favourite utility for **Resource Consumption analysis** is `htop`. This provides extensive information on overall CPU / RAM consumption with division by processes. A screenshot of the output is presented in `htop.png` file.
