### Task 1 - GitHub Actions Pipeline
#### Official Guide
I added basic github actions to the repository. Demo actions are mostly echo commands regarding various repository information. It seems it may execute wide viriety of commands like clean up of redundant files, making logs, etc.

#### Test of demo actions
I pushed this file to the repository and observed the Actions on the GitHub web-site. It did registered new actions executed by me and run all commands which were stated in the yml file including list of all root directory files.
