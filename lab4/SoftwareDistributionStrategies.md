### Definition of software distribution

Software distribution reffers to techniques of deployment of an application to customers or servers. It includes installation of necessary dependencies across oficially supported paltforms and systems.
It's significance can be described by the following points:
1. Easy access to an application for customers. Final customer should not have any troubles with the application installation
2. Software maintance optimization. With streamlined distribution process, it would significantly ease application update and customer service.
3. Efficient feedback collection. With standartised distribution, any user feedback will be relevant to the whole solution.

### Software distribution strategies

1. **Direct Distribution:** direct distribution to the customer:
   - Distribution throug own channels gigving full control on the distribution.
   - Provides a direct feedback line with a customers.
For instance, a Steam store application allow to directly download their application from the web-site. Customer may directly write to their customer service.

3. **Indirect Distribution:** indirect distribution, software will be delivered to the consumers through the third parties.
   - Distribution via brokers, mediators or other third parties.
   - Much larger potential customer base.
   - Allows to focus on certain distribution channels.
   Most of the application for an Apple devices are distributed via Apple mediator. Thus, the developers may reach the customers on Apple devices or explicetly focus on Apple customers.

4. Hybrid distribution is the combination of both direct and indirect distribution strategies.
   - Offers flexibility in reaching the customer base.
  For example a Steam app is available both on Apple Store and direct download. This allows developers to reach the Apple customers meanwhile maintain the preffered direct distribution methods.

5. **Packaged Software Distribution:** distribution via physycal media.
   - Software completely stored on a physical media.
   - Allows to include additional physical content to the application.
   Many gaming developers still distribute their contect partially via physical editions. This allow to include unique content to the package like the game merchandize.

6. **Cloud-Based Software Distribution**: distribution allows to bypass the installation process and use the application online.
   - Software is hosted on developer's servers and is accessible for users.
   - Requires computational power from the developers to maintain the application.
   - Allows to eliminate any system inconsistemcies.
   For instance, ChatGPT deploys it's solution in the cloud and users may iteract with it online.

### Best Practices for Software Distribution

1. **Strict definition of the targeted system:** solution distribution should be extensively tested on declared target systems. Otherwise a strict restrictions on system requirements have to be issued in order to avoid unexpected malfunctions.  
2. **Control of third party distribution:** althrough third parties allow to strongly widen the rechable market, it is required to make sure that customer service on their side is adequate and that all changes in the application get distributed to the end users.
3. **Cosntant monitoring and feedback collection:** in order to swiftly identify the application shortcomings, it is essential to make sure that key application performance metrics on end-devices are measured and the feedback can be reached to the Developer.
